# English through Film Final Exam Review - Dec. 16

**During the final exam, you will have a conversation with a different professor about a movie or TV show that you like or have recently watched and possibly other questions.**

Questions about a specific Movie or TV Show:

* Basic information to know:
    - what is the title of the movie/TV show?

     > The name of the movie I want to talk about is Leon which is shown in 1995 in Korea. I watched this movie at the age of 19 on the recommendation of my friend. Leon is the name of the main character of this movie. The movie is about the story of killer Leon and a girl Matilda whose family was killed by Norman Stansfield the senior executive of Drug Enforcement Administration. I thought the title is pretty proper to the movie since it showed us Leon’s character development well. Maybe someone can ask that why the title isn’t Matilda. But in my opinion, it’s more about Leon and nothing can replace it.

    - what is the genre of the movie/TV show?

     >  That’s really what I wanted to talk about. On the internet, many say that the genre of the movie is action or crime. But in my opinion, it’s just drama. Of course, there are actions and crimes in the movie. However, they are just tools to make the movie and story more dramatic. First, crimes make Matilda whose family was killed by Norman Stansfield the senior executive of Drug Enforcement Administration to meet Leon who is the killer and the main character of the movie. The story starts with the drug crime and it’s over with the action scene. However, overall, the film focuses on Leon and Matilda’s inner character development. In the movie, it’s not important how they meet or how Leon died. It’s important the fact that they meet and they changed after the encounter. So I want to say it’s genre is just drama.

    - what is the setting of the movie/TV show?

     >  The movie starts in New York’s Little Italy, and Leon the main character of the movie is described as having fled to the United States after killing his lover’s father who murdered his lover in Italy with his own hands. In U.S. Leon was a killer working for the money. And another main character Matilda is a girl whose family was killed by Norman Stansfield the senior executive of Drug Enforcement Administration. And Norman Stansfield, the main villain of the movie, is at the forefront of drug trade despite his status. And the story starts with a drug case related to Matilda’s father and Norman Stansfield.

* What did you feel was the mood of the movie/TV show? Do you feel that the mood fits the movie/TV show well?

    - How was the music? How would you critique the music?

    > Before I talk about the music of the movie, I think I need to talk about the scenes In the movie. Many scenes show us Leon and Matilda’s emotional line and their inner character. While the story goes on, they become to form a bond and the director shows us with very detailed products including music.  And all the music fits in the scenes. However it’s not just music is fantastic or not but every production such as acting, probs, music are in harmony. But one music, Shape of my heart by sting which is music for the ending of Leon is so outstanding that everyone knows the music. Have you ever heard the Shape of my heart? Even though you don’t know the name of it, if you listen to it, you will know what it is.

* What is the plot of the movie/TV show? Tell me about the plot (conflict, climax, etc.).

    - Did you think the plot told the story well?

    > Perfectly. I mean, there is no defect in the plot of the movie. From exposition to resolution, they fit perfectly with each other. Let me explain the whole plot roughly first. At first, because of Matilda’s father, Norman Stansfield came to find the drug and killed all of her family. While he was killing her family, Matilda came back from the market and she saw that some guys with guns are in her home. So she acted like that she is not a member of her family then go to the front of Leon’s house, asking to open the door to save her. After Matilda met Leon, she figured out that Leon is a killer so ask him to teach her to be a killer. After that Leon took care of her and they made a bond. At last Norman Stansfield attacked them and Leon tried to save Matilda from him. However, Leon succeeds to save Matilda but not himself. Before Norman killed Leon, he detonated a bomb and blew himself up with Norman. Therefore, Matilda became perfectly safe from the threat of Norman. Through this plot, the movie shows us stories of Leon and Matilda which is the main of the movie. I fell deeply into this story

    - Did you like how the plot ended? Why or why not?

    > At the end of this movie, Leon detonated a bomb and blew himself up with villain Norman, which means that one of the main characters died in the movie. Someone said it's a sad ending because the main character Leon didn't survive and if he survived, they could be happier than the original story. However, for me, it was a perfect ending because I don't think they could be happier if Leon survived. Leon, the main character of the movie, was a killer who killed people for money. And Matilda is a girl who is still young and needed more care from adults. However, Leon could take care of himself but not of Matilda. In the movie, he kept showing us that he is awkward in taking care of Matilda. Even he could take care of Matilda, she would become a killer following him, which is not a really good ending. And she also might be in danger by Norman because she is the only survivor of the tragedy made by Norman. However, by the death of Leon and Norman, Matilda became perfectly safe and she also got a chance to be normal again. That's why I think the ending is perfect. How do you think if the ending was different?

* Who are the main characters in the movie/TV show?

    - Tell me about some of the characters that you liked/disliked. Why do you feel this way?

    > The character I liked is Leon who is the main character of the movie. His job is a killer which means that he kills people for money. However, in the movie, he is innocent and has a warm heart. Even though he was a killer, he has a belief that he doesn't kill women and children and he didn't smoke, drink, drug. Of course, I'm not saying that it's right to kill people. But when he came to the U.S. he was a murderer, and he didn't have any chance to get a job. And he met Tony who gives requests to kill people. I think that's why Leon became a killer. If he met other people who could give him a chance to get other jobs, he would get the job. I mean, he was just unlucky that the environment around him led him to be a killer. There is a plant that Leon always carrying and he thinks it as his other-self. It shows his mind that he cannot settle down anywhere. He needed someone to settle down and he finally finds out by dying to save Matilda.

    - Was there any character development? Was there any conflict?

    > Yes. Especially Matilda. When her family was alive, she was treated as a bundle so there was no one that she can settle down. Only her little brother was her family to Matilda. However, after Norman killed all of her family, she was lost in the world. And she met Leon. She lost her house to go back so Leon took care of her. While Leon was taking care of her, Matilda kept asking him to teach to be a killer. And so on, she felt relief when she was with Leon, so she confused her mind that she loves Leon. However, in my opinion, it was close to family love because Leon was the first person who was being her guardian. At last, after Leon died, she came back to school and she put the plant that Leon always took care, and said "I think we'll be okay here, Leon" which means that she will find somewhere to settle down.

    - Do you think this character is a moral character? What kind of character is he/she?

    > Actually, I think there is no one who is moral in general. Leon was a killer, Matilda didn't go to school, and especially Norman was a complete immoral character. However, in person, Leon was moral who didn't betray his belief that he doesn't kill women and children. Actually he is kind of innocent that he just knows to kill people for money.

* Was there a message in the movie/TV show?

    - What lesson can you learn from the movie/TV show?

    > k

    - Did you agree with or disagree with the message/lesson of the movie?

    > y

* What else can you tell me about this movie/TV show that you liked/disliked? (acting, music, CGI, directing, quality, etc.)

    > I want to talk about acting. All of the actors' acting was so great. Leon's acting the awkwardness when he was with Matilda emphasized that he was innocent. And Matilda, Natalie Portman, when Norman was killing her family and she found out that, she just walked to Leon's house and begged him to be in. And it made me nervous too. I still can't believe that she was just 13 when she acted Matilda. And Norman Stansfield, Gary Oldman who is one of the best actors in the world, his acting was just insane. He acted in a frenzy of madness. I think even Joker can't follow his madness.

* What ranking would you give this movie/TV show? Do you recommend it for others to see? Why or why not?

    > u
